# Safety Brace and Brackets

## Design considerations

- Centerpiece held in place from the tension of two equal weights on opposite sides
- ANSI Chain No. 25 used to connect the pulley systems.
    - 140 lbs is the rated working load of the chain
    - Specifications below:

    [PDF](https://www.renoldjeffrey.com/media/2395574/ansi-standard-roller-chain-renold-jeffrey.pdf)

- Used a 1:4 pulley system, translating 1/4 of the weight into the tension of the chain

Note: Part was assembled by 2 braces stacked on top of each other along with 4 face connectors to join the 2 braces together (all laser-cut from plywood)

Tying weights down during transportation of robot 2. Preventing weights from falling too far - Brace able to hold weight from 2 ft drop
