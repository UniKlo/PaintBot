## Design Goals
* Stablize spray gun during operation
** Created handle holder inserts to keep spray gun handle snugly fitted into encasing
** Front and back support created by 3D printing peices using Ender-3 3D printer with PLA filament
* Establish control over trigger handle
** Motor attached to encasing that rotates trigger press at exact angles to engage/disengage trigger on spray gun
