## Design considerations:
* Spraying paint was chosen as the superior option over using brushes and/or rollers as it reduces complexity for paint integration with the robot
* Negatives for paint brush/roller:
  * Paint brush/roller would need to be reloaded with paint after each usage (reloading with paint adds complexity to robot)
  * Haptic feedback would need to be integrated into the system to ensure proper paint coating on surface
* Positives for spray gun:
  * Robot can operate for extended time without reloading paint (compressor can be connected to 5 GAL pail of paint)
  * Haptic feedback would not need to be addressed
  * More control of coating on surface by controlling pressure and movement of spray gun
