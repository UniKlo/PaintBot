<img src="https://github.com/UniKlo/PaintBot/blob/master/img_gif/pulley%20weights.jpg" height="400px"/>

## Design Goals
* Develop Cartesian plane control with the use of tension in the chains
  * Achieved by using a pulley system with weights to create tension
* Minimum cost
  * Bricks were readily available (other forms of weights can be used)
  * Encasing was custom-made from aluminum scraps to hold bricks
