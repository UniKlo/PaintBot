## Design goals
* Create a structure addressing the following points:
  * Low-cost to manufacture 
    * Cost of materials is less than 75 USD
  * Easy to access and modify 
    * Basic structure gives plenty of room for modification for future iterations
    * Ex. The height of the pillars can be adjusted to paint at higher elevations
  * Waterproof 
    * Stain each piece with waterproof paint before assembly 
  * Has 4 anchor points 
    * Dimensions are arbitary as we only need 4 anchor points to fully operate the PaintBot
