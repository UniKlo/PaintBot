# Chain System

The goal of the centerpiece is to be able to move to any edge of the painting frame while constrained at each corner by tensioned chains. Via pulleys, the chain system allows that to happen by creating a pulling force via weights and by shortening the chain.

1. Pulley - At the top, the pulley has a double bearing to pull the chain to create top tension and bottom tension. At the bottom, it has a single bearing to loop to the top tension. Connects to the pillar via [Wooden Bracket](https://github.com/UniKlo/PaintBot/blob/master/Mechanics/Wooden%20Bracket).
2. Bolt - This is the main bolt that connect the gear to the motor box. It's here that the motion from the pulley system translates to motion in the [Motor Rack](https://github.com/UniKlo/PaintBot/tree/master/Mechanics/MotorRack).
3. Double bearing - Attaches to bottom corner inside [Motor Rack](https://github.com/UniKlo/PaintBot/tree/master/Mechanics/MotorRack).
4. Connection to Top of Centerpiece - This portion of the chain will connect to top of centerpiece to create top-tension.
5. Weight holder - Connects to [pulley weights](https://github.com/UniKlo/PaintBot/tree/master/Mechanics/PulleyWeights) to add tension to the system.
6. Single bearing - Attached to bottom of pillar, encased in [Wooden Bracket](https://github.com/UniKlo/PaintBot/blob/master/Mechanics/Wooden%20Bracket).
7. Connection to Bottom of Centerpiece - This portion of the chain will connect to top of centerpiece to create bottom-tension.

## Design considerations

- Centerpiece held in place from the tension of two equal weights on opposite sides
- Uses a 1 to 4 pulley system, where 1/4 of the force from the weight being pulled down distributes one quarter of tension to each connection in the chain.

## Parts
- ANSI Chain No. 25 used to connect the pulley systems.
    - 140 lbs is the rated working load of the chain
