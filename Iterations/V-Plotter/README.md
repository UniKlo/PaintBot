The very first iteration of PaintBot was a conventional V-Plotter based on [Maslow CNC](https://www.maslowcnc.com/). The design has many advantages as a start-point: many of the mechanical parts from the CNC could be translated to painting, the codebase is well tested and well documented and there's a large open-source community working to improve and extend the design. Most advantageous however, was the fact that this V-Plotter offered a very straight-forward triangular kinematics. Since the chains extending from each motor always share the same origin on the center-piece, the math to calculate how to move on a 2D plane is relatively simple. The design also has drawbacks. The center-piece of a CNC machine rests against the surface its working on and doesn't create any force from while in use. However, a paint-gun recoils as it shoots. As a v-plotter, the center-piece was too unstable and therefore, tensions was added to the bottom. While greatly stabilizing the center-piece, the kinematics are now undefined but can be worked-out by running the machine and collecting data.
